# GitHub GitOps Connector
GitHub GitOps Connector is a custom component with the goal of enriching the integration between GitHub and Flux so the user experience in the entire CI/CD process is smoother and more observable. 

GitHub GitOps Connector listens for the messages coming from [Flux Notification Controller](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/components/notification/controller/) and it takes corresponding actions with GitHub such as Git Commit status updates.
